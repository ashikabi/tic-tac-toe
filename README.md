Regarding the Rules Game:
---------------------------------

The typical Tic Tac Toe is a board with a 3x3 dimension, and is a game for two players, one of them use the "X"  the other one use the "0" (zero) the idea is put those marks in one interception of the board, 
once per turn. The winner is the first player to have in this case a 3 in line of it own mark, wheter is
a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line.

This project(current game) has a plus because is possible to create boards up to 13x13 which is pretty much, but is for demostrative purpose,
the same rule applies to any dimension, the idea is to have a "N" in line, horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
